## Introduction to Outcrop
Outcrop makes the use of the Minecraft Bedrock [*Websockets* API](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Commands/wsserver) easier by handling the websockets requests/responses through an API, which you
can use to interact with Minecraft, such as executing commands, detecting player actions such as:
- joining, 
- leaving, 
- dying, 
- chat messages,

or item events like:
- crafting,
- smelting,
- being dropped/destroyed
- and etc!


## Doesn't Gametest already fill this role?
While GameTest can be run on Worlds, Realms and Bedrock Dedicated Servers, there are some features it can't do right now, like support for more programming languages.
